We've been hard at work on a tool called [Lineman](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman) that helps you create web applications in JavaScript (and CoffeeScript!), and we're really excited to share it with you!

Tonight I recorded an [8-minute screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmZ4XRErYAI) to show you the ropes:

As time goes on, I'll go into more detail on both our motivations in writing Lineman as well as more advanced usage like overriding configuration defaults.

In the meantime, please give Lineman a spin and tell us what you think!
